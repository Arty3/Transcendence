# 2. Standard User Management

---

## Overview
The Standard User Management module handles user accounts, authentication, and profile management. It provides the core functionality needed for users to register, log in, and manage their profile information. User management is a fundamental requirement for any modern application.

## Key Components
The user management system consists of several interconnected components:

### 1. User Registration
- Allows new users to create accounts with username, email, and password
- Validates input to ensure data quality
- Checks for duplicate usernames and emails

### 2. Authentication
- Securely manages user login sessions
- Issues and validates JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication
- Handles logout and session management

### 3. Profile Management
- Enables users to view and update their profile information
- Allows uploading and updating profile pictures
- Manages display names and other user settings

### 4. Password Security
- Hashes passwords securely using bcrypt
- Prevents storage of plain-text passwords
- Enforces password complexity requirements

## User Flow
When interacting with the user management system, here's what typically happens:

1. **Registration**: User fills out registration form with username, email, and password
2. **Validation**: System checks if input is valid and username/email are available
3. **Account Creation**: User account is created with a hashed password
4. **Login**: User enters credentials and receives an authentication token
5. **Profile Access**: User can view and edit their profile using this token
6. **Profile Updates**: Changes to profile info are validated and saved to the database

## Database Structure
The user data is stored in the `users` table with these key fields:

- `id`: Unique identifier for each user
- `username`: User's chosen username (unique)
- `email`: User's email address (unique)
- `password_hash`: Securely hashed password
- `display_name`: User's public display name
- `avatar_url`: Path to the user's profile picture
- `created_at`: When the account was created
- `updated_at`: When the account was last updated

## Security Features
The module implements several security features to protect user data:

- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are never stored in plain text
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated before processing
- **Token-based Authentication**: Secure JWT tokens for session management
- **HTTPS**: All communication is encrypted using HTTPS
- **Account Recovery**: Password reset functionality (via email)

## Integration Points
The User Management module connects with other parts of the application:

- **Friends System**: Uses user IDs to establish friend connections
- **Game System**: Associates game records with user accounts
- **GDPR Compliance**: Provides data export and deletion capabilities
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Optional additional security layer

## Example API Endpoints

- `POST /api/auth/register` - Create a new user account
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticate and receive a token
- `GET /api/user/profile` - Get current user profile
- `PUT /api/user/profile` - Update user profile
- `POST /api/user/avatar` - Upload a profile picture

This system ensures secure, efficient user management while providing a seamless experience for users of the application.
