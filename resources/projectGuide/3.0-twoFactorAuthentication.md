# 3. Two-Factor Authentication

## Overview
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to user accounts by requiring a second verification step beyond just a password. In our implementation, users verify their identity through a time-based one-time password (TOTP) generated by authenticator apps like Google Authenticator.

## Why Use This Module?
2FA significantly enhances account security by:

- Protecting against password theft
- Preventing unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised
- Adding a time-sensitive verification layer
- Following industry best practices for account security

## How It Works
Our 2FA implementation uses the Speakeasy library and follows this process:

### Setup Phase:
1. User initiates 2FA setup in their account settings
2. Server generates a unique secret key for the user
3. A QR code is displayed for the user to scan with their authenticator app
4. User verifies setup by entering a code from their app

### Verification Phase:
1. During login, after password verification, user is prompted for a 2FA code
2. User enters the 6-digit code from their authenticator app
3. Server validates the code against the user's stored secret
4. If valid, login proceeds; if invalid, access is denied

## Integration with Google Authenticator
The system works with any TOTP-compliant authenticator app:

- Google Authenticator
- Microsoft Authenticator
- Authy
- Other TOTP-compatible apps

Users simply scan the provided QR code with their chosen app, which then generates time-based codes automatically.

## Technical Implementation
The 2FA module consists of:

- **Backend Services**: Generate secrets, create QR codes, verify tokens
- **API Endpoints**: Setup, enable/disable, and verify 2FA
- **Frontend Components**: User interface for setup and verification

## Security Considerations
Our implementation includes several security features:

- Secrets are stored securely in the database
- QR codes expire after a single use
- Time-based tokens rotate every 30 seconds
- Small verification window to account for time drift

## User Experience
We've designed the 2FA flow to be user-friendly:

- Clear step-by-step setup process
- Visual QR code scanning
- Simple 6-digit code entry
- Option to disable 2FA if needed

This module provides robust security while maintaining a smooth user experience, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized account access.
