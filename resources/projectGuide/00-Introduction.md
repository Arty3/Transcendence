# 0. Project Guide: Introduction

### Understanding the Modules

Welcome to the project guide! This document will walk you through the core concepts and mechanisms implemented in this project by exploring the modules one by one.

Rather than diving into every line of code, this guide aims to provide you with the **why** behind each decision and the **essence** of the mechanisms involved. By the end of this guide, you will have a clear understanding of the architecture and functionality of the chosen modules.
