# 3. Two-Factor Authentication

---

## Overview
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to confirm their identity using two different methods. This system includes a Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP) feature, which helps protect accounts against stolen passwords. The setup follows the OATH TOTP guidelines outlined in RFC 6238, a standard provided by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to ensure consistent and secure implementation.

## Security Benefits Analysis
The 2FA module makes the application much more secure in several ways

| Threat Vector | Without 2FA | With 2FA |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| Password theft via phishing | High risk of account compromise | Attacker lacks second factor, limiting breach window |
| Credential stuffing attacks | Vulnerable if password reuse exists | Requires physical access to authenticator device |
| Brute force attempts | Protected only by password complexity | Additional 6-digit dynamic code requirement |
| Session hijacking | Token theft grants full access | Verification required for sensitive operations |
| Database breaches | Exposed hashes may be cracked | TOTP secrets require additional compromise |

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Secret Management**
   - Creates secure, random codes for each user.
   - Saves these codes in a safe, encrypted way.
   - Links each code to a user account.

2. **TOTP Generator and Checker**
   - Uses a standard method (RFC 6238) to create time-based codes.
   - Changes the code every 30 seconds.
   - Can handle small time differences between devices.
   - Tracks code use to prevent reuse.

3. **QR Code Maker**
   - Creates links that apps like Google Authenticator can scan.
   - Makes QR codes that are easy to read and reliable.
   - Includes the app name and your username in the code.

4. **User Interface (UI)**
   - Step-by-step setup wizard.
   - Input field for entering codes.
   - Tools to manage account recovery if access is lost.

### Implementation Details

#### Secret Generation Process
```javascript
/* Implemented in the backend using the Speakeasy library */

const secret: speakeasy.GeneratedSecret = speakeasy.generateSecret(
    {name: `FT_Transcendence:${user.username}`});
```

#### Verification Algorithm
The system uses a sliding window to verify codes:
- First, it checks the current time window.
- Then, it checks the previous and next windows (±1) which is 1 time step before and after the current time.
- If the same code is used more than once, it is rejected (anti-replay).


```javascript
/* VERIFY TOKEN */
return speakeasy.totp.verify({
   secret: user.two_factor_secret,
   encoding: "base32",
   token: token,
   window: 1
});
```

## Database Schema Extensions
The 2FA module extends the user table with additional fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `two_factor_secret` | TEXT | Base32-encoded TOTP secret key |
| `two_factor_enabled` | INTEGER | Boolean flag indicating 2FA activation status |

---

## Integration Workflow

### Setup Process Flow
1. **Initialization**
    - User requests 2FA activation from account security settings
    - System validates user authentication state
    - Backend generates unique TOTP secret for user account

2. **QR Code Delivery**
    - System generates otpauth:// URI containing:
        - Secret key
        - Account identifier (username@application)
        - Algorithm parameters (SHA-1)
        - Time period (30 seconds)
    - URI is encoded as QR code and delivered to frontend

3. **Verification**
    - User scans QR with authenticator application
    - First TOTP code is generated on user device
    - User submits code to verify successful setup
    - System validates code against expected value
    - Upon verification, 2FA flag is activated in user account

4. **Confirmation**
    - User receives success confirmation
    - Account now requires 2FA codes for future logins

## API Endpoints

*API Endpoints are application routes (e.g., "GET /api/music/radiohead/daydreaming - Fetch the song")*

### 2FA Setup and Management
- `GET /api/2fa/setup` - Generate 2FA secret and QR code
    - Authentication: Required
    - Response: `{ secret: string, qr_code_url: string }`

- `POST /api/2fa/enable` - Activate 2FA after verification
    - Authentication: Required

## Security Hardening Measures
The system includes several security improvements:

1. **Anti-Replay Protection**
   - Ensures each code is unique within a set time period.
   - Blocks attacks using old codes.

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Limits verification attempts to 3 per 30 seconds.
   - Adds delays after repeated failures.

3. **Entropy Assurance**
   - Uses 160 bits of randomness for generated codes.
   - Ensures codes are created securely.

4. **Revocation Capability**
   - Admins can reset 2FA if needed.
   - Users can turn off 2FA with identity verification.

## Error Handling Approach
The system provides clear error messages. For setup issues, it detects incompatible devices or software and offers the option to retry with new codes. It also shows clear error messages with steps to fix the problem. For verification failures, the system tracks the number of attempts and shows the remaining tries.
