# 5.0 Multi-Player Game

---

## Overview

The **Multi-Player Game** module adds a new twist to the classic Pong game, turning it into a fun three-player experience.

## Gameplay Innovation Analysis

### Transitioning from Classic to Multi-Player
| Aspect | Classic Pong | Multi-Player Extension |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|
| Players | 2 players (left/right) | 3 players (left/right/bottom) |
| Movement Axes | Vertical only | Vertical (P1/P2) and Horizontal (P3) |
| Strategic Complexity | Linear opposition | Triangular competition dynamics |
| Scoring Mechanics | Binary point attribution | Multi-target point system |
| Game Pacing | Predictable trajectories | Complex bounces and interactions |
---

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
The multiplayer game is built with four main systems:

1. **Rendering Engine**
    - Displays the game using a canvas.
    - Optimizes animation for smooth gameplay.

2. **Physics System**
    - Calculates the ball’s movement.
    - Detects collisions with different surfaces.
    - Handles angle changes when the ball hits surfaces.
    - Manages ball speed and direction.

3. **Input Manager**
    - Detects multiple key presses at once.
    - Allows custom controls for each player.
    - Making sure that players can move independently on *one* keyboard.

4. **State Controller**
    - Tracks scores for three players.
    - Determines the winner.
    - Manages game progress.
    - Saves match results.

## Game Physics Model

### Collision System
The game has an improved physics system with:

1. **Ball Bounce Mechanics**
    - Calculates the angle the ball bounces based on where it hits.
    - Vertical paddles (Players 1 & 2): mainly affect the ball's horizontal speed.
    - Horizontal paddle (Player 3): mainly affects the ball's vertical speed.
    - Corners are handled with special angle calculations.


2. **Difficulty Adjustment**
    - Ball speed gets faster during long rallies.
    - Speed resets after a point is scored.
    - Maximum speed is capped to keep the game fair.

3. **Edge Case Handling**
    - Prevents the ball from getting stuck.
    - Makes sure the ball doesn't move at too shallow an angle.
    - Prevents visual glitches by allowing small changes when an egde case collision happens.

## Input Management System

### Keyboard Control Implementation

| Player | Primary Controls | Action |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Player 1 (Left) | W key | Move paddle up |
|  | S key | Move paddle down |
| Player 2 (Right) | P key | Move paddle up |
|  | L key | Move paddle down |
| Player 3 (Bottom) | V key | Move paddle left |
|  | B key | Move paddle right |

The input system is designed to be quick and responsive by:

1. **Simultaneous Key Processing**
   ```javascript
   const pressed_keys = 
   {
       'w': false, 's': false,  /* Player 1 */
       'p': false, 'l': false,  /* Player 2 */
       'v': false, 'b': false   /* Player 3 */
   };
   
   /* Key state tracking */
   const handle_key_down = (keyboard_event) => 
   {
       const key = keyboard_event.key.toLowerCase();
   
        if (['w', 's', 'p', 'l', 'v', 'b'].includes(key)) 
        {
           pressed_keys[key] = true;
        }
   };
   ```

2. **Frame-Based Position Updates**
   ```javascript
   /* Processes all currently pressed keys in each animation frame */
   const process_keyboard_input = () => 
   {
       if (!game_started || is_game_paused) 
            return;
       
       /* Player 1 movement */
        if (pressed_keys['w']) 
        {
           game_state.paddle_left.y = Math.max(0, 
               game_state.paddle_left.y - PADDLE_SPEED);
        }
        if (pressed_keys['s']) 
        {
           game_state.paddle_left.y = Math.min(CANVAS_HEIGHT - PADDLE_HEIGHT, 
               game_state.paddle_left.y + PADDLE_SPEED);
       }
       
       /* [Similar logic for Players 2 and 3]... */
   };
   ```

3. **Boundary Constraint Enforcement**
    - Prevents paddles from moving outside the playable area
    - Implements smooth stop behavior at canvas edges
    - Maintains consistent movement speed for fair gameplay

## Score Management System

### Points Allocation
The scoring system works like this:

- **How Points are Scored**
    - If Player 1 misses on the right side, Player 1 gets a point.
    - If Player 2 misses on the left side, Player 2 gets a point.
    - If Player 3 misses in the bottom area, Player 3 gets a point.
    - The first player to reach 5 points wins the match.


- **Winner Determination**
   ```javascript
   /* Check for winning condition. int POINTS_TO_WIN = 5 */
   if (new_score.left >= POINTS_TO_WIN) 
   {
       setTimeout(() => 
       {
           if (!game_completed.current) end_game(player1);
       }, 0);
   } 
   else if (new_score.right >= POINTS_TO_WIN) 
   {
       setTimeout(() =>
       {
           if (!game_completed.current) end_game(player2);
       }, 0);
   } 
   else if (new_score.bottom !== undefined && 
              new_score.bottom >= POINTS_TO_WIN) 
   {
       setTimeout(() => 
       {
           if (!game_completed.current) end_game(player3);
       }, 0);
   }
   ```

## Database Integration

### Match Recording System
After a multiplayer game ends, the system saves detailed match data:

1. **Saving Game Data**
    - Stores the winner's information as player 2.
    - Tracks the match time and duration.

3. **Tracking Stats**
    - Keeps records of wins and losses for signed-in user.
    - Tracks average scores and personal bests.
    - Stores opponent player 2 history and performance.
    - Differentiates between standard and multiplayer game types.
