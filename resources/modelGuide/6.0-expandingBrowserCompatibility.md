# 6.0 Expanding Browser Compatibility

---

## Overview
Our application ensures compatibility across modern browsers through simple configuration in our build process.

## Implementation
We added browser targets in our `package.json`'s **browserslist** configuration:

```json
{
  "browserslist": 
  {
    "production": 
    [
      ">0.2%",
      "not dead",
      "not op_mini all"
    ],
    "development": 
    [
      "last 1 chrome version",
      "last 1 firefox version"
    ]
  }
}

```

### Explanation of the Configuration

- **`">0.2%"` means**  
  This targets browsers with more than 0.2% of the global market share. It ensures the app supports a wide range of browsers that are still in active use.


- **`"not dead"` means**  
  This excludes browsers that are no longer maintained, ensuring the app does not target outdated or unsupported versions that could cause issues.


- **`"not op_mini all"` means**  
  This excludes all versions of Opera Mini, which has limitations when rendering modern web features, making it unsuitable for this application.


- **`"last 1 chrome version"` and `"last 1 firefox version"`**  
  These target the latest version of Chrome and Firefox browsers, ensuring that development is focused on the most recent and widely used versions.

### package.json

In Python, you only need to import external libraries into your file to use them. However, in Node.js (for .js/.tsx files), you need a separate `package.json` file. This file lists the required packages (dependencies) for your application, and they can be installed using a package manager like `npm install` (Node Package Manager).

The `package.json` file also includes important configuration information for the build process, such as browser compatibility, scripts, and dependencies. It helps manage the project's packages and ensures all required libraries are available to the application.
