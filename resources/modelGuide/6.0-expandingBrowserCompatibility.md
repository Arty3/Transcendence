# 6.0 Expanding Browser Compatibility

---

## Overview
Our application ensures compatibility across modern browsers through simple configuration in our build process.

---

## Implementation
We added browser targets in our `package.json`'s **browserslist** configuration:

```json
{
  "browserslist": 
  {
    "production": 
    [
      ">0.2%",
      "not dead",
      "not op_mini all"
    ],
    "development": 
    [
      "last 1 chrome version",
      "last 1 firefox version"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Configuration Explained

| Setting | Meaning | Benefit |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `>0.2%` | Browsers with more than 0.2% global market share | Ensures wide compatibility |
| `not dead` | Excludes unmaintained browsers | Avoids supporting outdated browsers |
| `not op_mini all` | Excludes all Opera Mini versions | Skips browsers that can't handle modern features |
| `last 1 chrome version` | Latest Chrome release (dev only) | Targets modern development environment |
| `last 1 firefox version` | Latest Firefox release (dev only) | Ensures testing in multiple engines |

## About package.json

Unlike Python, which only requires importing libraries, Node.js needs a `package.json` file to:

- List required dependencies
- Define build and run scripts
- Configure development tools
- Specify browser compatibility targets

This single configuration file helps ensure consistent development environments and proper application functionality across different browsers.
