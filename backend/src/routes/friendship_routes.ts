/*
backend/src/routes/friendship_routes.ts

This file defines API routes for managing friendships.
It includes endpoints for sending, accepting, and rejecting friend requests,
removing friends, and getting a user's friends list.

All routes are protected with JWT authentication, which ensures only logged-in users can access them. The server checks the user's token before allowing access.
